# Kanban_Board_Task_Management
Task Management using MERN 
The MyNotes website, built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack
Provides a comprehensive note-taking platform with user authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
Each user can create an account, log in securely, and access their own personal notes. The website allows users to create, view, edit, and delete their notes. The data is stored in MongoDB, and the backend API built with Node.js and Express.js handles the CRUD operations for notes. With JWT authentication, users can securely access and manage their notes from anywhere.
